## How it works

This is a simple Full Adder circuit that takes 1-bit inputs A and B, with consideration to a Carry-in value (input C).

## How to test

Explain how to use your project:
-
VCC sends a square wave to CLK, and you just turn the inputs A, B, and C "on" or "off." These three binary bits are added together to output a 2-bit binary number.

## External hardware

There are two outputs, which will go to two LEDs. Each LED represents a bit, so the number '3' would show two LEDs lit, which corresponds to the binary value '11'. There are also two switches for input, a step button, and a reset button. A square wave generator is used as well, although you don't need one.
